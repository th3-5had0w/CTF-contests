  puts("We access heap memory through the malloc(), and free() functions, both provided when you `#include <stdlib.h>`.");
  puts("malloc(n) will return a pointer to a chunk of memory with size n, and free(ptr) will deallocate a chunk of memory returned by malloc().");
  puts("In recent versions of GLIBC (>=2.26), free()d chunks that are small enough are put into a linked list called the tcache, where they will be returned on the next call to malloc() of the same size.");
  puts("This means that if we malloc(64), then free() the pointer we get from that, the next malloc(64) will return the same chunk.");
  puts("Demonstration:");
  puts("```");

  puts("This is done to optimize memory usage, because we don't want to be allocating new memory when we have memory that is no longer being used lying around.");
  puts("However, this makes it very dangerous to use a chunk after we have free()d it. The data in the chunk may have been returned to a different call to malloc(), and may have been used for another purpose.");
  puts("We would be able to overwrite important information because the chunk is now being used in two places.");
  puts("In addition to this, free()d chunks are part of linked lists, so by editing the first 8 bytes of a free()d chunk we often can control where the next chunk in the linked list is.");
  puts("The result of this is a possible arbitrary memory write if we can control the next pointer that malloc() returns.");

  puts("[Press enter to continue]");

  puts("At this point, because we have freed chunk `a`, then `b`, our tcache linked list (which is first in first out, meaning that new items are attached to the front of the list, and will be the first to be returned back) for size 128 looks like this: (note that by `head`, I mean the start of the linked list)");

  puts("One popular target, that will bypass full RELRO, is a function pointer in libc called `__free_hook`.");
  puts("This pointer, when not NULL, will be called whenever free() is called, and with the same arguments as well.");
  puts("Our goal here will be to write the address of system@libc to `__free_hook`.");
  puts("The result will be that every call to free() after this will be equivalent to a call to system().");
  puts("That means that if we free a chunk that has `/bin/sh` in it, we are essentially calling system(\"/bin/sh\")!");
  puts("Let's do this! You'll need this:");
  puts("----------------------------------------------------");
  printf("system @ %p\n", &system);
  puts("----------------------------------------------------");

  puts("By writing to the already free()d chunk at `b`, we have now corrupted the tcache linked list. It now looks like:");
  puts("----------------------------------------------------");

  puts("We have successfully controlled what malloc() returns!");
  puts("Let's say that we now wrote to the memory in the chunk returned by `d`.");
  puts("If all went well, we are now writing to the memory at `__free_hook`. Overwrite that with system now:");
  puts("```");
  puts("fgets(d, 128, stdin);");
  puts("```");
  fgets(d, 128, stdin);
  puts("OK. Now we will proceed to the last step. We will use chunk `c` as a scratchpad and write \"/bin/sh\" to it. Then we will free it, and hopefully call `system(\"/bin/sh\")` for a shell!");
  puts("```");
  puts("strcpy(c, \"/bin/sh\");");
